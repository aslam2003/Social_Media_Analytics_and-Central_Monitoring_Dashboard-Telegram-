shit. ok let's go pay for this window \n \nthe couple arrives at the front door of the broken window house and rings the doorbell. a very well dressed man answers the door, \"yeees..?\" \n \nhusband:

\"yeah i agree. i'm not thrilled about it but i get where he is coming from. play well do it\" \n \nthe master is thrilled and wisks the wife upstairs where they have loud, wall banging sex for hours on end. finally after all that time the master comes down in only his underwear and his unbuttoned dress shirt. he grabs a cup of water and drinks the whole thing. the master then asks the nearby husband, \" if you dont mind me asking how old are you ans your wife?\" \n \nhusband: \" well i'm 32 and she is 34, why do you ask?\" \n \nmaster: \"just curious as to how you guys still believe in

its not very ethical but theres this experimental drug we need to test the doctor takes a vial from a drawer this is a very potent aphrodisiac just one drop in a glass of water is enough to awaken the libido of a dying man when you feel its a special night and you want to have sex with your husband try and pour one drop in his glass and i can guarantee that you will see a new life in him \n \noh thank you doctor thank you so much tomorrow its our anniversary what better night to try it out \n \ntwo days pass the morning after the fated night the woman goes back to the doctor she appears disheveled barely being able to walk \n \nwhwhat happened asks the doctor visibly worried \n \noh doctor i feel so sad yesterday while we were having dinner i waited for him to go to the toilet and as you suggested i hastily poured one drop of the drug in his water glass but then i thought what if this is not enough its been a long time since hes shown any passion towards me so i poured another drop \n \nwait two drops but its dangerous we dont know what can happen if more than one drop is used \n \nbut then i felt so insecure what if he doesnt like my body anymore is two drops really enough i panicked and i emptied the whole vial in the glass of water \n \n \n \nhe came back from the toilet sat down and took a good sip from the glass he froze eyes wide the glass fell from his hand he stared at me like a predator stares at its prey then it happened he violently threw away everything that was on the table snorting and roaring grabbed me slammed me on the bare table tore my clothes as well as his and proceeded to have his way with me making animal sounds i had never heard him make \n \nim so sorry for you it must have been terrible \n \noh no doctor it was the best sex ive ever had in 30 years of marriage i orgasmed multiple times in a matter of minutes i saw a rough untamed side of my husband that i thought didnt exist \n \nwait you enjoyed it then why did you say you were sad \n \nwell it was our favourite restaurant i doubt well be able to show our faces again there\n\noldbutgold", "Keyword": [], "Option": "option3", "Count": 1, "User_ID": null, "Username": null},
